1.Am I on guard for “false friends” or misleading cognates between the source and target languages that could distort the meaning?
2.Do my word choices convey the same connotations in the target language? For example, while 'Latin school' in a German context implies a prestigious institution, a direct translation into Chinese may require a term like 'better school' to convey the same idea.
3.Does the translated text flow naturally in the target language, following the conventional writing style and grammar?
4.Have I adjusted idioms, humor or figures of speech to maintain the original’s intent and effect within the cultural context of the target language? (e.g., "raining cats and dogs" → "llueve a cántaros" in Spanish, or "下倾盆大雨" in Chinese)
5.When culture-specific terms (food, clothing, idioms, holidays etc.), practices, or references in the source are unfamiliar to  the target readers, have I adapted these in a way that a target reader can understand and appreciate (by using the original term, adding a brief explanation, or substituting with a culturally analogous reference/an equivalent concept etc.)?
6.Does the translation preserve the same meaning and implications of figurative language, such as metaphors or similes?  
7.Am I considering the context and unspoken implications so that the translation reflects the source text’s pragmatic meaning (tone, irony, implicature), not just the dictionary definitions of individual words?
8.Am I handling the cultural differences in how certain emotions, gestures, or expressions are described in an clear and understandable way?  
9.Am I avoiding excessive domestication that erases the source culture’s identity?
10.Am I balancing foreignizing strategies with the need for clarity so that I don’t drift into exoticizing the source culture for the target reader?
11.Have I considered the source culture’s context (historical period, locale, customs) well enough to translate cultural references accurately, knowing that each language group has its own culturally specific features?
12.Does the translation evoke the same cultural mood as the original?
13.Does my translation maintain the same tone and level of formality for each character or narrative voice as the original?
14.Is the tone (formal, informal, neutral, colloquial, etc.) consistent in my translation?
15.Does the narrative voice in my translation match the original novel’s narrative voice?
16.Am I preserving the author’s unique voice or style in the source text (e.g., terse and minimalist, or elaborate and lyrical) in my translation?
17.Have I preserved the narrative point of view and any shifts in perspective exactly as in the original?
18.Does the translation convey the author’s descriptive imagery vividly and accurately?
19.Have I maintained consistency in terminology, character names, slang, dialect and other key details throughout the text to avoid confusing the reader?
20.Have I kept track of plot details to ensure nothing got lost or altered in translation that would cause inconsistencies?
21.Have I maintained the same level of ambiguity or precision as the source text?
22.Would a reader of the translation sense the same narrator persona or character as in the original?
23.Am I conveying the author’s intent behind each passage – the subtext or purpose of why they wrote it – through my translation choices?
24.Is the translation phrased in the most natural way for the target language, achieving the “closest natural equivalent” of the source message?
25.Have I considered equivalence at multiple levels, at the word level, sentence level, textual level (cohesion), and pragmatic level (overall effect) – to ensure the translation works as a coherent whole?
