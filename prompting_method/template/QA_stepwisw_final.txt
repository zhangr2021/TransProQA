1.Identify any words that look similar in both languages. Am I on guard for “false friends” or misleading cognates between the source and target languages that could distort the meaning?
2.First, identify all proper names, noun phrases, and cultural/historical references in the source. Then answer: do my word choices convey the same connotations in the target language?  
Example: While "Latin school" in a German context implies a prestigious institution, a direct translation into Chinese may require a term like "better school" to convey the same idea.
3.Read the translation aloud. Check grammar and syntax. Does the translated text flow naturally in the target language, following conventional writing style and grammar?
4. Identify all idioms, jokes, metaphors, unusual expressions, and figures of speech in the source. For each, think about its intended effect or meaning. Have I adjusted them to maintain the original’s intent and effect within the cultural context of the target language? (e.g., "raining cats and dogs" → "llueve a cántaros" in Spanish, or "下倾盆大雨" in Chinese)
5.First, identify all culture-specific terms (food, clothing, idioms, holidays, etc.), practices, or cultural/historical references in the source. For terms that are unfamiliar to the target readers, answer: have I adapted them in a way that a target reader can understand and appreciate (by using the original term, adding a brief explanation, or substituting with a culturally analogous reference or equivalent concept)?
6.First, identify figurative language such as metaphors, similes, comparisons, or original images in the source. Analyze their meaning and emotional resonance. Does the translation preserve the same meaning and implications?
7. Reflect on tone, irony, suggestion, or hidden implications in the source. Does the translation reflect the source text’s pragmatic meaning/function, not just the dictionary definitions of individual words?
8.Am I handling cultural differences in how certain emotions, gestures, or expressions are described in a clear and understandable way?
9.Revisit all localized terms. Am I avoiding excessive domestication that erases the source culture’s identity?
10.Review translations that feel “foreign” or unusual. Am I balancing foreignizing strategies with the need for clarity so that I don’t drift into exoticizing the source culture for the target reader?
11.First, identify all cultural/historical references from the source. Think about the source culture’s context (historical period, locale, customs). Have I considered the context well enough to translate these references accurately, knowing that each language group has its own culturally specific features?
12.First, read the source text alone and summarize the cultural mood. Then read the translation and summarize the cultural mood. Determine: does the translation evoke the same cultural mood as the original?
13.Does my translation maintain the same tone and level of formality for each character or narrative voice as in the original?
14.Is the tone (formal, informal, neutral, colloquial, etc.) consistent in my translation?
15.Does the narrative voice in my translation match the original novel’s narrative voice?
16.Am I preserving the author’s unique voice or style in the source text (e.g., terse and minimalist, or elaborate and lyrical) in my translation?
17.Note the narrative perspective and any changes (1st person, 3rd limited, omniscient). Have I preserved the narrative point of view and any shifts in perspective exactly as in the original?
18.Highlight vivid descriptions and sensory language. Does the translation convey the author’s descriptive imagery vividly and accurately?
19.Track key terms, character names, invented words, slang, or dialects. Have I maintained consistency throughout the text to avoid confusing the reader?
20.Outline plot developments in the source. Have I kept track of plot details to ensure nothing was lost or altered in translation that would cause inconsistencies?
21.Have I maintained the same level of ambiguity or precision as the source text?
22.Understand who the narrator is and their role. Would a reader of the translation sense the same narrator persona or character as in the original?
23.For each passage, ask: why did the author write it this way? Then answer: am I conveying the author’s intent behind each passage—the subtext or purpose of why they wrote it—through my translation choices?
24.Read the translation as a native would. Is it phrased in the most natural way for the target language, achieving the “closest natural equivalent” of the source message?
25.Have I considered equivalence at multiple levels—word level, sentence level, textual level (cohesion), and pragmatic level (overall effect)—to ensure the translation works as a coherent whole?
